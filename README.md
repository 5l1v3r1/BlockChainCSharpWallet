<B>Goal</b><BR><BR>
The goal is to create an easy maintainable C# wallet for the BlockChain project.<BR><BR>
<B>How</b><BR><BR>
The GitHub repository for the wallet is split into 2 parts: <BR>
*The core code, this contains all the required classes and logics, independent of which GUI tool is chosen<BR>
*The GUI, which can be multiple GUI tools, starting with the Windows Forms, and then moving the GUI to Xamarin cross platform using the core code
<BR><BR>
  <B>Configuration</b><BR><BR>
Simply change the config.cs file which can be found under Solution/config.cs to the appropriate needs.
